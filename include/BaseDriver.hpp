/** A generic implementation of a packet extraction algorithm on an I/O device.
 *
 * This class provides the basic service or reading an I/O device until a full
 * packet has been read, and returning that packet. It does so while maintaining
 * a proper read and write timeout.
 *
 * To use this class:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> subclass it
 *   <li> give to the Driver constructor the maximum packet size that it can expect
 *   <li> implement extractPacket (see below)
 * </ul>
 *
 * Then, you can freely use writePacket and readPacket to write/read data from
 * the device.
 *
 * The issue that this class is trying to solve in a generic way is that, when
 * reading on I/O, one will seldom read a full packet at once. What this class
 * does is to accumulate data in readPacket, until the subclass-provided
 * extractPacket implementation finds a packet in the buffer. When a packet is
 * found, it is copied into the buffer given to readPacket and the packet size
 * is returned.
 *
 * See extractPacket for more information on how to implement this method.
